Title: pcabs - construct the pcabs-class from the Markov Equivalence Class
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Geke Pals
Maintainer: Geke Pals <gekehpals@gmail.com>
Description: This code adds information about a constructive tau-abstraction to the Markov Equivalence Class. This allows the code to direct edges that were undirected in the Markov Equivalence Class. The output of the code is the pcabs-class: between the Markov Equivalence Class and the Markov tau-Abstraction Equivalence Class. The code only removes models on which a constructive tau-abstraction is not possible. However, it cannot be guaranteed that a constructive tau-abstraction is possible on all models that are left in the pcabs-class.
